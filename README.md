Cell-Cell Communication Dynamics in the Tumor Microenvironment During Anti-PD1 Therapy in Breast Cancer Patients

This study investigates breast cancer's tumor microenvironment (TME) dynamics under anti-PD1 therapy. By analyzing single-cell sequencing, the research focuses on the response of T cells to antiPD-1 treatment and their communication with other significant cell types like myeloid cells. The objective is to map out and understand changes in cell-cell communication and identify key signaling responses with casual inference methods including conditional independence tests (CIT) and instrumental variables (IV). This will provide insights into the mechanisms of immune checkpoint blockade, potentially leading to new biomarkers and targeted therapies for breast cancer.
